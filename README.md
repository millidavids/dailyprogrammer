Daily Programmer

This is a collection of the programming challenges posed by the www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer subreddit. My compsci
career started with learning python, which is the language I used when starting these challenges. I will update this
README file with updates about other langauges that I use in this directory. Files named with no indication of langauge
are currently done in python.
