Daily Programmer

This is a collection of the programming challenges posed by the www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer subreddit. My compsci
career started with learning python, which is the language I used when starting these challenges. I will update this
README file with updates about other langauges that I use in this directory.

Edit (2015): My current job has me doing quite a bit of Ruby on Rails, so I have decided to switch to Ruby for the time being.
